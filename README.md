# Instructions to run the program

## Linear Programming solution
To run the python program for LPP solution using `Gurobipy` library
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python lpp.py <tc file name>`

## Polynomial Cloud Right Sizing Algorithm solution
- To run the program for this (in windows):
 ```g++ cred_refined.cpp && a.exe < <path to testcase txt file>```

- If you want to give input in the format mentioned for Test cases through `stdin`,
 ```g++ cred_refined.cpp && a.exe```

## First Fit Heuristic solution
- To run the program for this (in windows):
 ```g++ first_fit.cpp && a.exe < <path to textcase txt file>```
- If you want to give input in the format mentioned for Test cases through `stdin`,
 ```g++ cred_refined.cpp && a.exe```
